# HealthApp — Master Roadmap (SSOK)

Status: Active
Architecture: Clean Architecture + Feature-First + Deterministic-First Nutrition Engine

---

## SSOK Rules

- **ROADMAP.md is the Single Source of Knowledge (SSOK) for all planned and completed work.**
- Every task must have a stable ID, a status, and a Definition of Done.
- Task IDs are never reused. Completed tasks are marked `done`, never deleted.
- Larger epics must be broken into concrete, verifiable tasks.
- Task descriptions must be specific and checkable — not vague goals.
- No task may be marked `done` without passing verification (see VERIFY.md).

### Status values

| Status        | Meaning                           |
| ------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `todo`        | Planned, not started              |
| `in_progress` | Actively being worked on          |
| `blocked`     | Waiting on dependency or decision |
| `done`        | Completed and verified            |

---

## Principles

- Deterministic-first: prefer deterministic logic over AI/LLM calls
- AI only when deterministic logic is insufficient
- Clean Architecture: domain / application / infrastructure / presentation layers
- Feature-First: code organized by feature (nutrition, goals, auth, …)
- Trust/Confidence/Editability: every logged entry must be trustworthy and editable
- Small, incremental, reviewable changes only

---

## Current Focus

Core Logging Pipeline must be stable before any other feature work.

Definition of "working":

- `ei` → correct macros
- `zwei eier` → correct macros
- `200g quark` → correct macros
- `buttertoast` → correct macros
- `zwei scheiben schinken` → correct macros

---

# PHASE 0 — LOGGING MUST WORK

## P0-001 Disable Multi-Item Structuring

Status: `done`

Temporarily disable AI multi-item structuring.
No "AI structured multi-item meal" text.
No artificial splitting while deterministic parser is unstable.

**DoD:** Single item passes cleanly through the pipeline without AI structuring.

---

## P0-002 Single Item → Resolver → Macros Pipeline

Status: `in_progress`

Minimal working chain:

1. Input: raw text (e.g. "ei")
2. Deterministic normalization
3. Resolver call
4. USDA/OFF match
5. Macro calculation
6. Journal persistence
7. SummaryBar update

No Review Modal. No Confirm All. No extra layers.

**DoD:** 5 individual foods produce correct macros without zero-macro results.

---

## P0-003 Remove Review Modal (Temporary)

Status: `done`

Disable Review Entries. Remove Confirm All. Save directly after successful match.
On no match: show error.

**DoD:** Flow shortened. No forced confirm step.

---

## P0-004 Zero-Macro Blocker

Status: `todo`

If `kcal == 0`: block save, show error, no success status.

**DoD:** Saving an entry with zero macros is impossible.

---

## P0-005 Hard Default to Protokoll Tab

Status: `done`

`initialRouteName` = Protokoll. App starts on input tab.

**DoD:** App opens on Protokoll tab on cold start.

---

## P0-007 Proof-of-Call Tracing (Gate)

Status: `in_progress`

Verify full resolver call chain via logs:

- PROOF UseCase entered
- PROOF ABOUT_TO_RESOLVE
- PROOF RESOLVER_CALLED with sourceCount > 0
- PROOF OFF_SOURCE_CALLED and USDA_SOURCE_CALLED
- Either candidates > 0 OR explicit HTTP status/error logged

**DoD:** All five proof points visible in logs for a valid input.

---

# PHASE 1 — DETERMINISTIC MULTI-ITEM PARSING

## P1-001 Deterministic DE→EN Localization Alias Layer

Status: `done`

Deterministic step mapping common DE foods to EN equivalents for USDA source.
OFF targets original text.

**DoD:** Unit test for DE mapping passes (`npm run test`). `ei` returns candidates in manual app test.

---

## P1-002 Canonical Food Entity Dictionary + Source Adapters

Status: `todo`

Evolve flat alias map into structured canonical food entities with DE+EN alias lists,
portion hints, and source query adapters.
`detectCanonicalEntity()` for entity matching.
`getSourceQuery()` for per-source query routing.

**DoD:** ~20 canonical entities defined. Unit tests pass for DE+EN alias detection and source-specific query mapping. No macro key or unit inconsistencies.

**Verify:** `npx jest --testPathPattern="deEnAliases|smokeResolverDe"`, manual app test: "ei" produces candidates.

---

## EPIC: Resolver & Normalization

### P1-003 Multi-Item Split

Status: `todo`

Split input at "und", "mit", ",". Normalize number words. Force resolver per item.

**DoD:** "ei und quark" produces two separate resolved entries.

---

# PHASE 2 — GUARDRAILS, AUTH & SUBSCRIPTION

## EPIC: Supabase Foundation

### P2-001 Verify Environment Wiring

Status: `todo`

Ensure `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are strictly verified.
App throws fatal error on boot if variables are missing.

**Verify:** `npm run typecheck` + `npm run test` validating environment checks.

---

### P2-002 Enforce Single Supabase Client

Status: `todo`

Prevent any creation of new `createClient` instances globally.
`supabaseClient.ts` is the single source of truth.
No manual `fetch` calls to `/functions/v1/` exist.

**Verify:** `npm run lint` + global search for `fetch(` targeting Supabase URLs (must yield 0 results).

---

### P2-003 Document Edge Functions Deploy Process

Status: `todo`

Ensure `supabase/config.toml` is respected in deployment.
`verify_jwt=false` safely applied.
README section in `/supabase` on how to run `supabase functions deploy`.

**Verify:** Local `supabase start` parses `config.toml` and allows anonymous invokes.

---

## EPIC: Edge Guardrails (Food Search)

### P2-004 Query-length Guard and Sanitization

Status: `done`

Hard limit on food search query lengths. Sanitize input at Deno Edge function level.
Queries > 64 chars or containing special exploits blocked with 400.

---

### P2-005 Rate Limiting

Status: `done`

Basic rate limiting (IP/device based for anonymous).
Unauthenticated users cannot exceed 30 requests per minute to `food-search`.

---

### P2-006 Abuse Logging & Observability

Status: `done`

Structured logging for blocked requests (rate limit / guardrails) with `traceId` and user context.
Visible in Supabase Log Explorer as `ABUSE_DETECTED`.

---

### P2-007 Deploy & Verify Guardrails

Status: `todo`

Deploy guardrails with correct `verify_jwt=false` properties.
App calls remote endpoints anonymously without 401s.

**Verify:**

1. `npm run verify:supabase:link` must pass.
2. `npm run verify:schema` must pass.
3. `npm run deploy:edge:verify` must pass.

---

## EPIC: Auth & Subscription (Later)

### P2-008 Apple/Google Login via Supabase Auth

Status: `todo`

User can login via OAuth. App retrieves a valid Supabase JWT and stores it securely.

---

### P2-009 RevenueCat Entitlements

Status: `todo`

Integrate RevenueCat to manage subscription states.
`isPro` state synced from RevenueCat to Supabase `public.users` via Webhooks.

---

### P2-010 Paid-only Gating for AI Endpoints

Status: `todo`

Map `isPro` tier to Edge Function authorization.
AI structured log functions and premium insights return 403 for non-Pro users.

---

# PHASE 3 — MODULES (planned)

These modules are planned but not yet scoped into tasks.
Each will be broken into concrete tasks when Phase 0–2 are stable.

| Module      | Status | Notes                                 |
| ----------- | ------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Journal     | `todo` | Editable food log, daily view         |
| Goals       | `todo` | Macro targets, metabolism profile     |
| Saved Meals | `todo` | Reusable meal templates               |
| Reminders   | `todo` | Notification-based logging reminders  |
| Dashboard   | `todo` | Summary view, progress indicators     |
| Health Sync | `todo` | Apple Health / Google Fit integration |
| Insights    | `todo` | Trend analysis, weekly summaries      |

## Decisions Log

- **Anon vs. Auth for Food Search:** Food search functions are anon for MVP (`verify_jwt=false`) with strict guardrails.
- **AI Endpoints gating:** AI endpoints will never be anon. Strictly JWT + subscription/entitlement required.
- **Deterministic-first:** No LLM calls in core logging pipeline. AI only for complex multi-item parsing when deterministic logic is insufficient.
