## RESOLVER-V3-017 — Personal Memory Promotion and Correction Precedence

- **Basis:** `34fa3a1b42e637e75fb00d932166a31a24e4e2d7`.
- **Inventory:** logging is an implicit weak action; correction logs distinguish user/system edits; saved meals exist as personal templates; aliases, portion hints, resolver observations and journal snapshots are not reused as memory. Canonical catalog references are source-grounded; `user` source records are personal/manual. A dedicated private boundary is required.
- **Implemented contract:** `personal-resolution-memory-v1` defines closed P0/P1/P2, status, target references, evidence, transitions, and private correction negative evidence. The policy fails closed for unknown evidence/version and intentionally has no repetition threshold.
- **Storage:** one additive owner-scoped Supabase migration creates state/events tables with account cascade, RLS, no anon grant, and no views/aggregation.
- **Non-effect:** no resolver read/fast path/ranking/AI avoidance/global candidate path was added. V3-018 remains responsible for dependency invalidation and V3-019 for reads; V3-020 must not consume private memory.

## RESOLVER-V3-016 — Privacy Boundary Enforcement

- **Basiscommit:** `e67fb043e21796a937f5585475d80549ff2167ed` on expected base content; task branch `codex/resolver-v3-016-privacy-boundary`.
- **Policy:** `resolver-observation-privacy-v1`; executable field catalogs cover private storage columns and every V1 nested contract field. `owner_id`, row/observation/run IDs, and exact timestamps were corrected/treated as private or linkable exclusions, not operational projection fields.
- **Inventory:** raw/normalized inputs are free text; owner and IDs are direct/linkable; source `user` and its IDs are private; reason codes are only projectable from a closed allowlist. Structured V1 fields allowed in the in-memory-only projection are policy/contract version, locale, input type, outcome, candidate count, approved BLS/OFF/USDA source pair, provenance, resolver version, latency, and safe reason codes.
- **Excluded:** owner, raw/normalized text, all IDs/timestamps, journal/food-entry/correction links, metadata, provider data, prompts, secrets, headers, and stack traces. Normalized text remains blocked pending an explicit later policy/process; no hash or threshold is claimed as anonymization.
- **Deletion/retention/access:** deletion obtains the current owner through the canonical provider and deletes only that owner's private rows; missing owner fails closed. Existing account cascade and owner RLS remain unchanged. No automatic retention duration/job is introduced; no automatic candidate/global transfer exists.
- **Logging:** unconditional resolver logs containing raw or normalized query were converted to explicit debug-gated logs without input values. Observation errors log only closed codes; full Supabase response and owner are not logged.
- **Open questions:** future semantic alias/term aggregation, retention duration, and any controlled server path require a separate accepted policy. RESOLVER-V3-017 and V3-020 may begin in parallel on separate branches; V3-020 cannot read private rows as global candidates.
